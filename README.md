# psalmapi

A REST API of Pslams. Created as I was wanting to create a website that displays a random psalm upon open. However, there was no such API. So, I made my own.  Please let me know if there are any errors/bugs you encounter.

Deployed Link: https://restless-feather-6525.fly.dev/psalms

There is also a GraphQL version (REST API wrapped as GraphQL via Apollo Server): https://falling-frost-8420.fly.dev/ (github repo link: https://github.com/StanleyY7/psalmsGraphQL)

(Frontend in progress/development)
